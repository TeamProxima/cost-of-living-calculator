# Proxima
Proxima is a web application that shows the cost of living in any place in the world.

This application was originally made for a hackathon held by [Koding](http://koding.com) in 2016.

## How does it work?
Proxima asks you some questions, and calculates monthly cost for one person by joining them with the data we got from Numbeo.
